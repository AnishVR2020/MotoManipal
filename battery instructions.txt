1. put pressure release valve
2. put 20mm difference in hv components. velments may be taken as container d.5.1.4.
3. hv needs to be protected against side crash, inside a reinforced structure--> for structural integrity d.5.2.1.
4. hvs connections should be impossible to touch with a cylinder probe of 100mm length and 6mm dia. d.5.4.1.
5. hvs connections need to be plastic encapsulated. d.5.4.2.
6. cables of HV needs to be ORANGE of nonflammable grade UL-94 V0, FAR25 or equivalent.
7. add current sensor on precharge circuit so that 5 tau is completed. if(ipre <= 100ma) maybeee 
8. ALWAYS ENSURE THE PRECHARGE STATE TURNS ON ATLEAST 30 SECONDS BEFORE. (if possible calculate input capacitance & use delay circuit 5tau)
9. have to use a different precharge stage so that it can also turn off with the main stage at the same time in some worst case.
10. every lv component needs fuse just more than max supply current.
11. charging contacts together when touched need to have an ip rating of ip65. d.8.3.3
12. charging port needs to be safegaurded from impact. d.8.3.4
13. msd needed so as to quickly disconnect the whole hv system.
14. dashboard should show the battery voltage at all times. also should have a red light to state that. d.10.1.1
15. killswitch fixed to chassis. d.10.3.3 rotary type
16. inner battery mountings decide.

1. charge enable.
2. thermister wires decide. 
3. current sensor placement.
4. read wiring the batteries, don't plug the bms until last step.
5. "verify cell voltage tap wiring" read.
6. download bms utility.
7. connect BMS to computer to all wiring harnesses.
8. program bms to profile set up wizard.
9. test the BMS for 1 charge-discharge cycle.
