1. find reverse force as a function of velocity.
2. throttle response and braking points on the track.
2.1 using the torque and power vs rpm curve find out a single gear ratio. find reverse torque. #
3. map it to power/ torque/rpm using some program.
4. find max current and its cumulative time, also make a function of heat generated inside motor and maybe other components. And use calculus to find effects of time.
5. use these parameters to decide battery, motorcontroller, cooling.

1.battery contactor having precharge check stage checking for abnormal currents. # using hall current sensor.
